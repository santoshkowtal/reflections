when would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local??
answer:
Keeping all the work locally makes the files available only to a particular user.
suppose a team of three people wanted to work on a project together, and each of them are working on 
different things then keeping the local repository makes little sense. This is the time when we make use of 
remote repository. using remote repository we can share the files of the project to all. we can all perform work
individually and then commit the changes to the remote repository. Doing this keeps the remote repository up to 
date and also there will be easy access to all of the team.
